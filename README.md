# Ransomware-Detection-Tool

This code uses the tkinter and Scapy libraries to construct a Python ransomware analysis tool that analyses one specific ransomware SCARAB. The standard Python GUI development library tkinter is used to produce an easy-to-use user interface. With tkinter, users may search for PCAP files, start the analysis process, and see the outcomes by interacting with elements like buttons, text boxes, and entry fields. In addition, the application can read PCAP files, retrieve network packets, and examine them for possible ransomware indicators thanks to Scapy, a potent toolkit for packet manipulation and analysis. The program provides a simple way to identify ransomware activity in network traffic by integrating these libraries. By effectively analyzing PCAP files and spotting unusual activity, users may strengthen their cybersecurity defenses against ransomware attacks.
